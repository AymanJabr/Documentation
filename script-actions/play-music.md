## Examples

### Play Music

The following will play the song, and once the song ends, it will simply stop.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play music mainTheme'
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Music Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('music', {
    'mainTheme': 'mainThemeSong.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Loop Music

The following will play the song, and once the song ends, it will start over on an infinite loop until it is stopped using the [Stop Music Action](stop-music.md).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play music mainTheme with loop'
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Music Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('music', {
    'mainTheme': 'mainThemeSong.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Fade In effect

The following will play the song, and will use a fade in effect.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play music mainTheme with fade 3'
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Music Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('music', {
    'mainTheme': 'mainThemeSong.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Custom Volume

The following will set the volume of this song to 73%.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play music mainTheme with volume 73'
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Music Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('music', {
    'mainTheme': 'mainThemeSong.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Please note however, that the user's preferences regarding volumes are always respected, which means that this percentage is taken from the current player preferences, meaning that if the player has set the volume to 50%, the actual volume value for the song will be the result of:

$$
50 * 0.73 = 36.5%
$$

### All Together

Of course, you can combine all of this properties, and remember the order doesn't really matter, you can write the properties on the order that feels more natural to you.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play music mainTheme with volume 100 loop fade 20'
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Music Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('music', {
    'mainTheme': 'mainThemeSong.mp3'
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
