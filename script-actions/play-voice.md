## Examples

### Play Voice

The following will play the sound, and once the sound ends, it will simply stop.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play voice dialog_001',
        'This is the dialog that the voice file is narrating',
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Voice Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('voice', {
    'dialog_001': 'dialog_file_1.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Loop Voice

The following will play the voice file, and once it ends, it will start over on an infinite loop until it is stopped using the [Stop Voice Action](stop-voice.md).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play voice dialog_001 with loop',
        'This is the dialog that the voice file is narrating',
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sound Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('voice', {
    'dialog_001': 'dialog_file_1.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Fade In effect

The following will play the voice file, and will use a fade in effect.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play voice dialog_001 with fade 3',
        'This is the dialog that the voice file is narrating',
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sound Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('voice', {
    'dialog_001': 'dialog_file_1.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Custom Volume

The following will set the volume of this voice to 73%.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play voice dialog_001 with volume 73',
        'This is the dialog that the voice file is narrating',
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sound Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('voice', {
    'dialog_001': 'dialog_file_1.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Please note however, that the user's preferences regarding volumes are always respected, which means that this percentage is taken from the current player preferences, meaning that if the player has set the volume to 50%, the actual volume value for the voice will be the result of:

$$
50 * 0.73 = 36.5%
$$

### All Together

Of course, you can combine all of this properties, and remember the order doesn't really matter, you can write the properties on the order that feels more natural to you.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Script" %}
```javascript
monogatari.script ({
    'Start': [
        'play voice dialog_001 with volume 100 loop fade 20',
        'This is the dialog that the voice file is narrating',
        'end'
    ]
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sound Assets" %}
```javascript
monogatari.assets ('voice', {
    'dialog_001': 'dialog_file_1.mp3'
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
