# Events

Monogatari has a lot of useful events that fire when certain engine events happen. These can be used to run your own custom functions with `monogatari.on ()`.

For example, the following code will create a function that will be run every time the didLoadGame event fires:

```javascript
monogatari.on ('didLoadGame', () => {
  // Something here
});
```
