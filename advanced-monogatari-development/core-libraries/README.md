# Core Libraries

On the very core of Monogatari, you'll find it has been built around the [Aegis Framework](https://aegisframework.com/) libraries.

These libraries are used both for functionality and styling so learning more about them will allow you to create even more amazing things!

## [Artemis: JavaScript Library](https://gitlab.com/AegisFramework/Artemis)

Artemis is used for DOM manipulation, storage, HTTP requests handling, text transformations and more!

## [Kayros: CSS Library](https://gitlab.com/AegisFramework/Kayros)

Kayros is the very base of Monogatari's style and look!

## [Pandora: Web Components Library](https://gitlab.com/AegisFramework/pandora/)

Pandora is what allows monogatari to have self contained, custom HTML elements and allows them to have custom functionality.
